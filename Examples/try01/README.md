Purpose
-------
This repository focuses on cataloging the development of a thermohydraulic model of an experiment at the UW-Madison.
The experiment is a closed-loop, natural circulation system with water as a working fluid.
The model is written for a safety analysis program called [`MELCOR`](http://melcor.sandia.gov/ "MELCOR webpage link").

 To do List
------------
- [ ] Need to update the diameters to the experiment's true values
- [ ] Need to adjust the height of the risers and chimney for two phase experiments
- [ ] In-file documentation of components
- [ ] Comprehensive calculation notebook (for Mr. Oh)
